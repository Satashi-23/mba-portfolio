## About Me {#about}

<div class="about-container">

<div class="about-text">

I am an MBA candidate at University Canada West with a professional background in education and administration. My experience as a Primary School Teacher and Administrative Assistant has strengthened my ability to lead teams, manage operations, and communicate complex ideas clearly across diverse stakeholders.

Working in both academic and administrative environments has shaped my structured and disciplined approach to problem-solving. I am particularly interested in how data analytics and strategic decision-making improve organizational performance and long-term sustainability. Through my MBA studies—especially in Business Predictive Analytics—I am developing the ability to translate data into actionable business insights.

My goal is to transition into roles where analytical thinking, operational efficiency, and strategic planning drive measurable impact.
